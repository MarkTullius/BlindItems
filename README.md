# Blind Items

Obscures the pickup models and inventory icons, for items and equipments, by replacing them with '?' to add a cursed challenge where you don't know what you're picking up (scrapping/printing) until you have done so.

Config options available to allow the icon for equipments, as well as randomising the order of your inventory upon entering a new stage and obscuring all pickup notifications for an increased challenge.
